---

## 📊 Comparison

| Version | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| v1.0.6 | ✅ Uploaded successfully | First working version |
| v1.0.8 | ❌ Upload failed | Error: "Package does not contain a schema" |
| v1.0.9 | 🧪 Testing | Identical to v1.0.8, new version number |

---

## 🔍 Analysis

Since v1.0.6 and v1.0.8 are **identical** except for version numbers, the upload failure suggests:

### Most Likely Cause:
**Plugin already installed** - The Authoring Tool may require uninstalling v1.0.6 before uploading a newer version.

### Testing Hypothesis:
1. Uninstall v1.0.6 from Authoring Tool
2. Upload v1.0.9 (fresh install, not update)
3. If successful, confirms the issue was "update detection"
