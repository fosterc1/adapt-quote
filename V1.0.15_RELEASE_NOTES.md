# 🎉 v1.0.15 Release Notes - LESS Compilation Fix

**Release Date**: 2025-11-13  
**Version**: 1.0.15  
**Status**: ✅ Production Ready

## Critical Fix

This release fixes the **LESS compilation error** that was preventing course builds:

```
NameError: .respond-to-small-device is undefined in 
src/components/adapt-fadetext/less/fadetext.less on line 106
```

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Removed Undefined Adapt Mixins
- ❌ Removed: `.respond-to-small-device()`
- ❌ Removed: `.respond-to-medium-device()`
- ❌ Removed: `.respond-to-large-device()`
- ❌ Removed: `.text-styling()`

### 2. Replaced with Standard CSS
✅ **New responsive approach** using standard `@media` queries:

```less
// Small devices (mobile)
@media (max-width: 760px) {
  .fadetext {
    &__content {
      --fadetext-font-size: 0.9rem;
      padding: 1rem;
    }
  }
}

// Medium devices (tablet)
@media (min-width: 761px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
  .fadetext {
    &__content {
      --fadetext-font-size: 1rem;
    }
  }
}

// Large devices (desktop)
@media (min-width: 1025px) {
  .fadetext {
    &__content {
      --fadetext-font-size: 1.1rem;
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Added Fallback Variables
✅ **Self-contained LESS** with fallback values:

```less
// Fallback variables if not defined by theme
@component-padding: 2rem;
@focus-outline: #4285f4;
```

## Benefits

### ✅ Better Compatibility
- Works with all Adapt Framework versions
- No dependency on theme-specific mixins
- Self-contained styling

### ✅ Standard CSS
- Uses widely-supported media queries
- Easier to understand and maintain
- More predictable behavior

### ✅ No Build Errors
- Course compilation now succeeds
- Plugin builds cleanly
- Ready for production use

## Breakpoints

| Device | Breakpoint | Font Size |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Mobile | max-width: 760px | 0.9rem |
| Tablet | 761px - 1024px | 1rem |
| Desktop | min-width: 1025px | 1.1rem |

## Migration from v1.0.12/v1.0.14

No migration needed! Just replace the old version:

1. Delete old plugin version from Adapt Authoring Tool
2. Upload v1.0.15
3. Rebuild your course
4. ✅ Should compile successfully!

## Download

### ✅ From GitHub Releases (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://github.com/fosterc1/adapt-fadetext/releases/tag/v1.0.15
2. Download: `adapt-fadetext-v1.0.15-production.zip`
3. Upload to Adapt Authoring Tool

### ❌ Don't Use Main Branch ZIP
Remember: Do NOT use the "Download ZIP" button from the main branch page!
- Main branch creates: `adapt-fadetext-main/` (wrong folder name)

## Testing

### ✅ Verified
- LESS compiles without errors
- Media queries work correctly
- Responsive behavior maintained
- Course builds successfully

### Test Your Installation
1. Upload v1.0.15 to Adapt Authoring Tool
2. Add component to a course
3. Build the course (Development or Production)
4. Should compile without errors ✅
5. Preview in browser - responsive sizing should work

## Troubleshooting

### If Build Still Fails

**Check for these issues:**

1. **Old cached version**: Clear browser cache and Adapt cache
2. **Multiple versions**: Ensure old plugin versions are deleted
3. **Theme conflicts**: Check if your theme defines conflicting styles

### Still Having Issues?

Check these files in your Adapt installation:
- Is `adapt-fadetext` folder name correct? (not `adapt-fadetext-main`)
- Is bower.json version showing 1.0.15?
- Are there any other LESS files conflicting?

## Version History
